# Prefetch Cleanup

### Overview

#### Prefetch Cleanup was created for the purpose of seamlessly removing files, specifically from the C:\Windows\Prefetch folder.
#### I created a simple command line program which will clear them, saving you time in the process.  

### Usecase

#### Simply run the executable(.exe) file and enjoy a cleaner, lighter Windows.

### Security

##### Note** Administrator privileges have been written into this applications manifest file.
##### Running any executable involved in purging files/folders in C:\Windows will require heightened permissions.
