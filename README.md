# Prefetch Cleanup

### Overview:

##### Prefetch Cleanup was created for the purpose of seamlessly removing pesky files (which always collect no matter what the windows user does). 
##### I created a simple command line program which will clear these files, saving you time for other things. 
##### Just be sure to be on an Administrator Account or have Administrator privileges. 

### Usecase:

##### Simply run the exe file (best to run as admin), and enjoy a cleaner, lighter Windows.
