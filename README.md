# Prefetch Cleanup

### Overview

#### Prefetch Cleanup was created for the purpose of seamlessly removing pesky files, specifically from the C:\Windows\Prefetch folder.
#### I created a simple command line program which will clear these files, saving you time for other things.  

### Usecase

#### Simply run the exe file and enjoy a cleaner, lighter Windows.

### Security

#### Note** Use an Admin Account or have Administrator privileges.
#### Running any executable involved in purging files/folders in C:\Windows will require heightened permissions.
