# Prefetch Cleanup

### Overview

#### Prefetch Cleanup was created for the purpose of seamlessly removing pesky files (which always collect no matter what the windows user does). 
#### I created a simple command line program which will clear these files, saving you time for other things.  

### Usecase

#### Simply run the exe file (best to run as admin), and enjoy a cleaner, lighter Windows.

### Security

#### Note** Use an Admin Account or have Administrator privileges. 
#### Running any program involved in writing or purging files/folders in C:\Windows will require heightened permissions.
